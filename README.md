# soilc-targets

Tools to compare observed soil organic matter levels to regional targets to determine soil health

Functions are: 

id.county, which returns latlong coordinates from geo information for a farm
SSURGO_scrub, which uses latlong to pull soil series information from SSURGO and soil carbon data from RaCA by interfacing with the soilDB R package
